# Predicting Success on Yelp

Yelp holds contests for students and the public in which the company releases a large amount of data and participants compete to reach one of a few specialized goals, ranging from building social network graphs to creating image recognition models. Our project uses this data to tackle our own question: Can we predict whether a restaurant has a good rating (four or five stars) or a bad rating (one, two, or three stars)?

+ ### The slide deck from our presentation is the file [Predicting Success on Yelp](Predicting%20Success%20on%20Yelp.pdf)
+ ### The Jupyter Notebook, with the technical details of our project, is the file [Technical_Notebook](Technical_Notebook.ipynb)
+ ### The [tn_helper](tn_helper.py) and [data_clean_process](data_clean_process.py) files contain Python functions used in the technical notebook, and [business_data](business_data.zip) is a saved copy of some of the data we are using. (This is necessary for the notebook to function when the postgres server is not online.)
