# Predicting Success on Yelp

Yelp holds contests for students and the public where they release a large amount of data, and then have the particpants compete to reach one of a few specialized goals, ranging from building social network graphs to image recognition.Our project uses this data to tackle our own question; can we predict whether a restaurant has a good rating (four or five stars) or a bad rating (one, two or three stars)?

+ ### The slide deck from our presentation is the file [Predicting Success on Yelp](Predicting%20Success%20on%20Yelp.pdf)
+ ### The Jupyter Notebook with the technical details of our project is the file [Technical_Notebook](Technical_Notebook.ipynb)
+ [tn_helper](tn_helper.py) and [data_clean_process](data_clean_process.py) contain python functions used in the technical notebook, and [business_data](business_data.zip) is a saved copy of some of the data we were using. (This is necessary for the notebook to function when the postgres server is not online.
